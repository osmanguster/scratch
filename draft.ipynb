    "Quantum algorithms are analogous to their classical counterparts, except they run on a quantum system. Throughout the past three decades, we have seen several algorithms start out as theoretical models to eventually be run and tested on physical implementations. In this independent study, we are interested experimenting with IBMâ€™s quantum information science kit (Qiskit), which is an SDK capable of developing algorithms using the quantum circuit model. We begin by studying the fundamentals of several quantum logic gates, and their respective functions. Next, several algorithms/protocols that are relatively simple to construct in the circuit model are analyzed and these may include, superdense coding, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and quantum teleportation. The focal point of the study is to determine if further adding to the current superdense coding scheme is possible with this SDK, such as more than two parties and dimensions. Local simulation of the algorithms is possible, however, Qiskit is capable of running algorithms on real quantum computer backends, so it would be interesting to analyze results from that type of test."

    "At the most fundamental level of our everyday classical computers, information is stored in bits, short for binary digits. They are reffered to as \"Binary\" because of two possible states, 0 or 1, at any given time. To perform a computation on some input bits, we use logic gates that implement some function to produce an output. Nowadays, the processors in our computers, phones and other devices perform operations on many bits stored in memory. Looking into a modern processor, we can see many different sections, but the main point is drawn from the physical implementations of the bits themselves. They are small, nano-meter scale transistors that turn on and off, which correspond to the two logic levels of 1 and 0.\n",

    "The physics of classical computers has ever since been defined by classical electrodynamics, and the realization of them today has been built upon by engineers and computer scientists. However, the past few decades has seen the emergence of quantum information science, where quantum mechanical effects in information theory are studied. Researchers cover problems ranging from \"Does a quantum computer even have an advantage over a classical computer?\" to \"How do we implement a 100 qubit quantum processor with negligble noise?\"\n",
